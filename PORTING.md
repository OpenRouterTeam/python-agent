# Porting

This package is a **port** of the OpenRouter TypeScript Agent SDK
(`@openrouter/agent`). TypeScript is the reference spec; this repo tracks it
automatically using [Upstreamer](https://github.com/mountgram/upstreamer) (MIT).

Behavioral divergence from the TypeScript reference is a **bug**, unless it is
listed in the Idiomatic Divergences section of `.upstreamer/upstreamer.md`.

## How it works

```
typescript-agent publishes @openrouter/agent to npm
        │
        │  repository_dispatch: openrouter-agent-published
        ▼
.github/workflows/upstreamer-port.yaml
        │
        ▼
scripts/upstream
        │  1. fetch upstream, resolve target commit
        │  2. compare against .upstreamer/state.yaml — skip if unchanged
        │  3. opencode runs the port against .upstreamer/upstreamer.md
        │  4. .upstreamer/scripts/verify.sh   (mechanical gate)
        │  5. .upstreamer/eval.md            (parity gate, fresh context)
        │  6. advance state.yaml — ONLY if both gates pass
        ▼
    Pull request  (never a direct push to main)
```

A weekly cron backs up the dispatch in case one is missed, and
`workflow_dispatch` allows a manual run against any ref.

## The contract is the product

`.upstreamer/upstreamer.md` is the durable artifact — it defines scope, the
required public API, naming maps, permanent idiomatic divergences, and the
substrate pin. The ported source is an *output* of that contract.

So when the port gets something wrong, **fix the contract**, not just the
generated code. A code-only fix gets re-broken on the next sync; a contract fix
holds.

## Files

| Path | What |
|------|------|
| `.upstreamer/upstreamer.md` | The rewrite contract. Binding. |
| `.upstreamer/state.yaml` | Last commit ported *and* verified *and* eval-passed. |
| `.upstreamer/scripts/verify.sh` | Mechanical gate: build, lint, types, tests, required API. |
| `.upstreamer/eval.md` | Parity gate: fresh-context behavioral review. |
| `.upstreamer/eval-report.md` | Latest eval result, or a bankruptcy report. |
| `.upstreamer/skills/upstreamer-converter/` | Execution discipline for the porting agent. |
| `.upstreamer/skills/port-test-quality/` | How to port upstream tests and keep coverage honest. |
| `.upstreamer/port.env` | Local secrets. **Gitignored.** |
| `scripts/upstream` | The wrapper. |

## Two gates, and why state matters

**Mechanical** (`verify.sh`) — objective: does it build, lint, type-check (`src`
*and* `tests`), pass tests, hold the coverage floor, and export every symbol the
contract requires. It also reports which upstream test files have no Python
counterpart — advisory, since severity is the eval's call.

**Parity** (`eval.md`) — judgment, run in a fresh context that reads the upstream
reference directly: does it actually *behave* like upstream. This is the gate that
catches a port which compiles cleanly while sitting a version behind on real
behavior.

If either gate fails the run **declares bankruptcy**: `state.yaml` is left
untouched and `.upstreamer/eval-report.md` explains why. A stale state file is the
correct outcome for a failed port — it makes the next run retry the same delta
instead of skipping past the gap. The workflow labels such a PR `eval-failed` and
marks the title `do not merge`.

Never hand-edit `state.yaml` to make a run look successful.

## Running it locally

```bash
# one-time
bun install -g opencode-ai          # or: npm install -g opencode-ai
cp .upstreamer/port.env.example .upstreamer/port.env
# then edit .upstreamer/port.env and fill in OPENROUTER_API_KEY + OPENCODE_MODEL

./scripts/upstream                  # sync if upstream changed
./scripts/upstream --force           # re-run after editing the contract
./scripts/upstream --ref v0.8.0      # port a specific upstream ref
./scripts/upstream -- --print-logs   # pass args through to opencode
```

`--force` is the escape hatch for a changed contract with unchanged upstream.
Expect to use it often while the contract is still settling.

## Credentials

Two values, same names locally and in CI:

| Name | Where | What |
|------|-------|------|
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | local: `.upstreamer/port.env` · CI: repo **secret** | `sk-or-…` key opencode uses for inference |
| `OPENCODE_MODEL` | local: `.upstreamer/port.env` · CI: repo **variable** | e.g. `openrouter/~anthropic/claude-opus-latest` |

The wrapper writes the key into `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json` so headless
runs work without the interactive `opencode /connect` flow.

This is a load-bearing SDK port behind a strict parity eval — use a strong coding
model. `OPENCODE_MODEL` overrides the `model:` field in the contract, so you can
change models without a code change.

## Reviewing a port PR

Review it as a *port*, not a normal diff:

1. Check `.upstreamer/eval-report.md` first. If state did not advance, stop.
2. Read the upstream delta yourself for anything load-bearing — the tool loop,
   state serialization, approval/HITL ordering, hooks, streaming.
3. Confirm new tests assert *upstream behavior*, not merely the port's own shape.
   The contract's Test Parity section lists the patterns that look like coverage
   and are not — membership-only stream assertions, `assert x is not None` as a
   test's only assertion, "a tool ran" where the invariant is *exactly once*.
   Check the verifier's test-parity note for upstream test files left unported.
4. Any new naming mapping the run derived should be promoted into the contract's
   naming table.
5. Check the coverage floor did not move down. It is a ratchet; lowering it needs
   a stated reason.
